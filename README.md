# saas-react-ts
This is a page I made based on a [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/AeA53Ggoh3CIqwqeh97GAX/Saas-Landing-Pages-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=hCwgT8ZFaW0XsO62-0) to practice react with typescript. I also used vite and tailwind.
However, I still have to make some changes regarding sizing, animations and fix some visual errors.
